[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mikegrb/Net-Abuse-Utils.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mikegrb/Net-Abuse-Utils)

# VERSION

version 0.23

# SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Abuse::Utils qw( :all );
    print "IP Whois Contacts: ", join( ' ', get_ipwi_contacts($ip) ), "\n";
    print "Abuse.net Contacts: ", get_abusenet_contact($domain), "\n";

# DESCRIPTION

Net::Abuse::Utils provides serveral functions useful for determining
information about an IP address including contact/reporting addresses,
ASN/network info, reverse dns, and DNSBL listing status.  Functions which take
an IP accept either IPv6 or IPv4 IPs unless indicated otherwise.

# VERSION

version 0.23

# CONFIGURATION

There is a `@RESOLVERS` package variable you can use to specify name servers
different than the systems nameservers for queries from this module.  If you
intend to use Google's nameservers here, please see [This issue on GitHub for a note of caution](https://github.com/mikegrb/Net-Abuse-Utils/issues/9\#issuecomment-24387435).

# FUNCTIONS

The following functions are exportable from this module.  You may import all
of them into your namespace with the `:all` tag.

## get\_asn\_info ( IP )

Returns a list containing (ASN, Network/Mask, CC code, RIR, modified date)
for the network announcing `IP`.

## get\_all\_asn\_info ( IP )

Returns a reference to a list of listrefs containting ASN(s), Network,Mask,
CC code, RIR, and modified date fall all networks announcing `IP`.

## get\_peer\_info ( IP )

IPv4 Only. Returns an array of hash references containing (ASN, Network/Mask,
CC code, RIR, modified date) for the peers of the network announcing `IP`.

## get\_as\_description ( ASN )

Returns the AS description for `ASN`. 

## get\_as\_company ( ASN )

Similiar to `get_as_description` but attempts to clean it up some before
returning it.

## get\_soa\_contact( IP )

Returns the SOA contact email address for the reverse DNS /24
zone containing `IP`.

## get\_ipwi\_contacts( IP )

Returns a list of all email addresses found in whois information
for `IP` with duplicates removed.

## get\_rdns( IP )

Returns the reverse PTR for `IP`.

## get\_dnsbl\_listing( IP, DNSBL zone )

IPv4 Only. Returns the listing text for `IP` for the designated DNSBL.
`DNSBL zone` should be the zone used for looking up addresses in the
blocking list.

## get\_ip\_country( IP )

Returns the 2 letter country code for `IP`.

## get\_asn\_country( ASN )

Returns the 2 letter country code for `ASN`.

## get\_abusenet\_contact ( domain )

Returns the abuse.net listed contact email addresses for `domain`.

## is\_ip ( IP )

Returns true if `IP` looks like an IP, false otherwise.

## get\_domain ( IP )

Takes a hostname and attempts to return the domain name.

## get\_malware ( md5 )

Takes a malware md5 hash and tests it against
http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/MHR. Returns a HASHREF of last\_seen and
detection\_rate.

# DIAGNOSTICS

Each subroutine will return undef if unsuccessful.  In the furture,
debugging output will be available.

# CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

There are two commented out lines that can be uncommented to enable Memoize
support.  I haven't yet decided whether to include this option by default.  It
may be made available in the future via an import flag to use.

# DEPENDENCIES

This module makes use of the following modules:

[Net::IP](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::IP), [Net::DNS](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::DNS), [Net::Whois::IP](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::Whois::IP), and [Email::Address](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Email::Address)
